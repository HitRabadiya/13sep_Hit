1. What is SDLC? 

-> It is a process followed for software building within a software organization. SDLC consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop,    maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the all-around       development process. 

2. Explain each phase of SDLC?

-> Requirement analysis :-  requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs,                             and sales department/market surveys.

-> Planning             :- Planning is a crucial step in everything, just as in software development.

-> Software design      :- SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the                                requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document                                    Specification (DDS). 

-> Software development :- At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming                                code as per the design in the DDS.

-> Testing              :- After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although,                             minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC.

-> Deployment           :- delivering and installing the software to the end-users.
